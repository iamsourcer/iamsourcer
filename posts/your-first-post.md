Alright! Now we are talking we are now live from my blog - I made it this far LOL - 

** This is Day 20 of Isolation due to COVID-19 **

I never thought of getting involved in history but now I can say that I'am someone who lived at the time of such a life-threatening event like this - WOW, I am sure that this will be remembered. Is this real or are we just part of some lousy Tom Cruise future-type movie? Anyways, I'am definitely hopping for this NOT to be my last post but the beginning of many more interesting ones.

#So who am I?
Jon for the friends, @Iamsourcr for my followers on Twitter.  I'm a Sourcing Scientist during the day and a Python-Geek-wannabe during night time. 

Hope to see you around as there's so much to tell and many more questions to answer.
