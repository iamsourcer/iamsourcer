Alright! Now we are talking.  This is Day 20 of Isolation due to COVID-19.  I never thought being involved in history - I'm now someone who lived in the era of such a life-threatening event like this - that will remembered for ages. 

There are days were I would just wake up and think "Is this real or are we just part of some lousy Tom Cruise future-type movie ???" Anyways, I'am definitely hopping for this NOT to be my last post but the beginning of many more interesting posts.

So who am I? Jon for the friends, @Iamsourcr for my followers on Twitter.  Sourcing Scientist during the day and Python Geek wannabe during the evening. 

Hope to see you around, there's much more to tell.
