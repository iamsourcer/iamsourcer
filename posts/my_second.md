### Still live and kicking they'd say

Over 20 days of quarantine and lock-down have passed and now we move towards another two happy more weeks... YEY! 
Luckily for me, nothing has changed much.  On my favor, being someone who works from home has helped the occasion and,
aside of work I'm still planning to squeeze a few things out of this 2020. 

So, keeping up with our 2020 nominees we have:

- **Reading** I'd say reading more is definitely something I've always wanted to do more but, for some reason, I keep _procrastinating_ on.  Oh that word,
at least new in my dictionary **"procrastination -** _the action of delaying or postponing something._ " It has been waiting for
me all of this time. Even worse, I'd say it **was** made for me.   I've recently discovered that we can _read faster_ by applying some very interesting
techniques (nothing really complicated but indeed involving, like anything else, some good dedication and practice. 

- **Python Programming** (So far I'm keeping up with my python tutoring in hope to some day turning into that glorious nirvana coding life) Not less
to mention, this blog is made out of the amazing static generator [Nikola](getnikola.com) which is easy to learn everyone should at least try for a quick spin.

- **Sourcing** It's still what makes my day and pays the bills.  It's a continuous learning and, as many things in life, you need
to keep up with as it keeps evolving. Exploring and trying new things out in order to become a true sourcing "Jedi" master is defintely part of my plan and why
not combining Python + Sourcing (hmm, that sounds interesting).

Now before I go, I'd like to leave something behind and I can keep this as sort of a log.  Have you ever thought of sourcing from **Hackerrank** ??
Here's an interesting take away I've just discovered and that anyone can start playing with.

By using **site:hackerrank.com/profile/** is the targeted way to find hackerrank profiles on Google. Using the site: would do this magic trick.  
Now if you look closer by adding the keyword:"Current" and keyword:"Education" it will allow getting rid of pretty much all junk results
with nothing more but - as Golum would say - our lovely _precious profiles_.  Although there's some sort of location added to each profile, the question here is:

> How can you possibly target specifc locations?

The answer is ... drumroll ... **EDUCATION!** 
Here's my work-around.  I went back to Google and did a simple search [**universities in california**](https://www.google.com/search?q=universities+in+california) and that's pretty much it.
If you combine the above with a very specific university (Just pick one, I can't do your job) you can not only target famous university students but also the place where they can possibly be located. 

Let's try this out and put everything into practice. 

Say we wanted people who may possibly be around "San Jose, CA", attended Stanford and have Python skills. 
Here's how our string would look like:
> **site:www.hackerrank.com/  education* *"san jose state" badges*python** 

Always think outside the BOX! What if we wanted people at a very specific company and country?? **Easy!**
> **site:hackerrank.com/profile/* current* *Juniper "United States"** 

Keep playing with this, combine stuff and show me your results! 

Happy hunting guys! **\m/**
